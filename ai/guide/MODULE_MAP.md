# Module map — directory → responsibility → entry point

> [!NOTE]
> **This is a scaffolded template.** Run the `/cold-start` slash command in Claude Code (or see [docs/FAQ.md#cursor-copilot-codex](../../docs/FAQ.md#cursor-copilot-codex) for other tools) to have the agent explore your repository and automatically populate this file.

> **Index only.** Find the area here, then open the entry file directly. Don't crawl

> Last verified: <fill in date> @ commit <fill in sha>

## Stability legend (the most important column)
- `frozen` — inherited / load-bearing legacy. **DO NOT edit** without explicit instruction.
- `stable` — works; change carefully and with tests.
- `ours`   — active development surface. Safe for agents to modify.
- `?`      — not yet audited. **Treat as `frozen` until a human decides.**

## Modules (run `/cold-start` to populate, then audit)
| Directory | Responsibility (one line) | Entry point | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|
| <fill in> | <fill in> | <fill in> | ? |

Detected test locations (from orient): <fill in during cold start>

## Audit protocol
1. /cold-start fills rows and tags them `[inferred]`.
2. A human sets Stability per row and flips confirmed rows to `[verified] (date)`.
3. Agents treat `?` rows as `frozen`. Agents never flip tags.
