# ai/lab/ — development intelligence for syson-plus-plus

The strategic layer: *how* we build and *what we learned* — not code, not navigation.
Loaded when planning or reviewing, not on every agent session.

| Folder | Contains | Who writes it |
|---|---|---|
| `specs/` | One spec per planned/in-progress feature | Human + AI draft |
| `decisions/` | Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) | Human |
| `evaluations/` | Post-implementation retrospectives | Human |
| `experiments/` | AI-agent approach trials: prompts, configs, outcomes | Human + AI |

## Lifecycle of a feature
```
1. Plan      →  specs/SPEC_<name>.md          (copy SPEC_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Decide    →  decisions/ADR_<n>-<title>.md  (any non-obvious design choice)
3. Implement →  /add-feature — the agent reads the spec
4. Evaluate  →  evaluations/EVAL_<name>.md    (after the feature ships)
5. Learn     →  experiments/EXP_<n>-<desc>.md (if the AI approach was novel or failed)
6. Archive   →  mark spec implemented; entry lands in ai/analysis/FEATURE_CATALOG.md
```
